# Charts for BenchmarkDotNet

This [web app][ChartsForBenchmarkDotNet] allows you to create a visual representation of your [BenchmarkDotNet] console results. You can conveniently copy the generated chart to your clipboard, save it as a PNG image, or share it through a URL.

It currently understands standard results like the one shown below. Any columns between `Method`/`Runtime` and `Mean` are considered categories in the chart across the x-axis. These columns are typically created via properties decorated with the [`Params`](https://benchmarkdotnet.org/articles/features/parameterization.html) attribute in your benchmark.

**Generated Chart**

## How do I use it?
Just paste your [BenchmarkDotNet] console results into [the app][ChartsForBenchmarkDotNet]. The chart will be automatically generated. A few controls are provided above the chart, allowing you to customize the size, metric to display, y-axis scale, and theme.

> üí° You can also paste the content of the `.md` file created after running your benchmarks. It's typically stored in the following project directory: `bin\Release\[Runtime]\BenchmarkDotNet.Artifacts\results`
