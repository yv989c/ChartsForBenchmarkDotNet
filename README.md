# Charts for BenchmarkDotNet

A simple web app that charts your [BenchmarkDotNet](https://benchmarkdotnet.org/) console results. The chart can then be copied to your clipboard or downloaded as a PNG image.

It currently understands standard results like the one shown below. Any columns between `Method` and `Mean` are considered categories in the chart across the x-axis. These columns are typically created via properties decorated with the `Params` attribute in your benchmark.


## How do I use it?
Just `copy` the output of your console containing the results and `paste` it in [the app](https://chartbenchmark.net/). The chart will be automatically generated.

Console Output Example:
```ini
BenchmarkDotNet=v0.13.2, OS=Windows 11 (10.0.22621.674)
AMD Ryzen 9 6900HS Creator Edition, 1 CPU, 16 logical and 8 physical cores

> üí° You can also paste the content of the `.md` file created after running your benchmarks. It's typically stored in the following project directory: `bin\Release\[Runtime]\BenchmarkDotNet.Artifacts\results`

There are a few controls above the chart that allows you customize the size, theme, and the y-axe scale.
